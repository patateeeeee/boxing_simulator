# ðŸ¥ŠBoxing SimulatorðŸ¥Š

An interactive mini-game in Python/OpenCV where you have to hit targets on the screen with your hands, detected in real time by your webcam using MediaPipe Pose (PoseNet model).  
Obstacles appear to make the game more challenging, and a custom head image is displayed live on your head!

## Features

- **Hand and head detection** with MediaPipe Pose
- **Targets to hit** with your hand (real-time scoring)
- **Dynamic obstacles** to avoid with your head
- **Custom head overlay** on the player (image/head.png)

## Screenshots

Stand up in front of your screen and hit the red circles:
